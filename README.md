# Fastmail Bulk Manager

‚ö†Ô∏è **ALPHA SOFTWARE** - Test safely with a Fastmail trial account, or create backups if using your existing account.

A web-based tool for efficiently managing bulk email in Fastmail. Review messages you've moved to your bulk folder and take batch actions like moving all messages from specific senders or creating automatic filter rules.

**Cross-Device Integration**: Detects messages moved to bulk from any device - whether you used the Fastmail iPhone app, Android app, web interface, or any email client.

## Quick Start

1. **Test safely**: Use a [Fastmail trial account](https://app.fastmail.com/signup/) or [create backups](BACKUP.md) of your existing account
2. Download `fastmail-bulk-manager.html` from this repository
3. Open the file in any modern web browser
4. Generate an App Password in Fastmail (Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí App Passwords)
5. Connect and start managing your bulk email efficiently

## Key Features

- **Periodic Review Interface**: Scan bulk folder and group recent messages by sender
- **Safety First**: All actions require explicit confirmation dialogs
- **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple senders for batch processing
- **Message Moving**: Move all non-bulk messages from selected senders to bulk folder
- **Auto-Rule Creation**: Generate Sieve filter rules for automatic future filtering
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works on any modern browser across all operating systems

## How It Works

1. **Mobile Workflow**: Use Fastmail's mobile apps to quickly bulk unwanted emails throughout the day
2. **Desktop Review**: Run this tool periodically to batch-process all those senders
3. **Smart Actions**: Move remaining messages and/or create auto-rules for future emails
4. **Cross-Platform**: Detects bulk moves from any device via direct JMAP connection

**Example Workflow**: Bulk emails on your phone during commutes, then run weekly cleanup sessions on your laptop to batch-process all those senders and create auto-rules.
